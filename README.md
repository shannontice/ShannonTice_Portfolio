# ShannonTice_Portfolio
## Description

In this project we created a Protfolio wedpage to showcase some of our completed work for potential employers. The HTML and CSS were written from scratch and we ensured that the webpage would be maintained regardless of what viewport was being utilized by the viewer. Links at the top of the page allow navigation throughout the site and the project tiles link to completed work repositoires.
